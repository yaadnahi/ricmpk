              Raising our children in faith and giving them biblical teachings at a younger age empowers their

              Having a thorough knowledge and deep understanding of the true Biblical teachings is crucial for any

              Pastor Tariq Paul, is an eloquent speaker of God. Although born and raised in a Christian home, he
              didn't knew much about his faith until in his early twenties Lord showed him the way to eternal life.
              From that point on, he gave his life to the Savior Lord Jesus Christ, went to ZBI(Zarephath Bible
              Institute) and learned Christian Theology with compassion. He then got affiliated with FGA (Full Gospel
              Assemblies of Pakistan) and did a lot of work to preach the Gospel in the remote areas of Pakistan. In
              2008, laid the foundation of FGA Church in Bahawalpur, Pakistan.

              More recently, God provoked him to expand the boundaries of preaching the Gospel, which gave birth to
              RICM (Reborn In Christ Ministries) Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to preach the Gospel in unconventional
              ways, to reach many people so that they repent and are saved in Christ.
              Include prominent works.

              Pastor Shagufta Paul, is a practicing nurse and leads the women ministry. Born in a Catholic home, she
              was ingrained with the Catholic traditions. She was a bright student and always had a keen interest in
              learning new stuff. She always kept herself in the light of the Bible, that is where God showed her the
              true way, the only way to salvation. She continued her studies and learned Christian Theology at
              Zarephath Bible Institute(ZBI).

              Her primary focus in the ministry is to empower women in their professional and household lives as well
              as in Christ. She strongly believes the fact that women who follow Christ are more content and give rise
              to a God-centered family. May the Lord use her to the fullest of His needs.

          Who we are?

        <span class="answer">
          Reborn In Christ Ministries Pakistan, was founded by Pastor Tariq Paul and Pastor Shagufta Paul, both keen
          to spread the Gospel among many lost Christians. Our motto is to uplift the Christian community in Pakistan.
          Also to help them unlearn the wrong teachings, wrong traditions that they have adopted, which are the result
          of decades of brain washing by incompetent false teachers/preachers.
        </span>

        <span class="query">
          What we believe?
        </span>

        <span class="answer">
          We believe in the fact that we came to this world as sinners, we are sinners. As we've broken God's Law, we
          need His mercy, His forgiveness. There's definitely a way for redemption. 2000 years ago, God became a human
          being, Jesus of Nazareth, who took our sins and gave His life on the cross and rose on the 3rd day. Jesus is
          the only way for us to secure our eternity and be united with God. We make the Bible as the basis for our
          all our teachings.

        <p class="country-para">
          Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan is home to many people with varying cultural, ethnic, religious
          backgrounds. A country whose major revenue generator is the agriculturual industry. The fact that it is the
          fifth most populous country in the world makes life tougher than ever. With scarce resources, it is becoming
          increasingly challenging to cope with the issues that arise day after day.
        </p>

        <p class="country-para">
          Pakistan is gifted with many natural resources, which include many precious stones and minerals. It's
          strategic location also gives the country many advantages. Scenic landscapes in the northern areas increase
          its beauty by a thousand times. It is also home to many historical landmarks left by the Mughal and the
          British Empires. Despite the fact the over the past decades Pakistan has received notoriety for safety
          concerns but still its tourism flourishes.
        </p>

        <p class="country-para">
          Christians make up 1.6% of the total population. Our ministry focuses to make their lives a little better.
          Although we have to go through a lot of trouble to work for them. God has given us the responsibility for
          this overwhelming task, and we believe that He will help us to spread the Gospel.
        </p>

        <p class="country-para">
          May the Lord shower His blessings on Pakistan. May this nation prosper over the coming years and
          forevermore.
